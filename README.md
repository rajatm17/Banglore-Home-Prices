## Bangalore House Price Prediction Model (**85% Accuracy Achieved!**)

**Project Overview**

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bangalore, India. The model achieves an impressive **85% accuracy** on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating house values. 

**Data Science Workflow**

The project follows a comprehensive data science workflow, encompassing several key stages:

* **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Outlier Detection and Treatment**
* **Feature Engineering**
* **Dimensionality Reduction (if applicable)**
* **Model Selection and Training**
* **Model Evaluation**
* **Visualization (optional)**

**Detailed Workflow Steps**

1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**

    - Load data from reliable sources (replace with details of your data source).
    - Address missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation, deletion).
    - Ensure data integrity for accurate analysis (e.g., data type checks, consistency checks).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

    - Utilize Matplotlib to visualize relationships between features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms) and the target variable (house price).
    - Gain insights into the data distribution and identify potential patterns (e.g., correlations, outliers).

3. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**

    - Identify outliers that could skew model predictions (e.g., using statistical methods or visualizations).
    - Strategically handle outliers using removal, transformation, or winsorization (capping extreme values).

4. **Feature Engineering**

    - Create new features that might be more informative for the model.
    - Examples could include:
        - Calculating price per square foot.
        - Creating categorical features for location categories.
        - Deriving a "year built" feature from the data.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction (if applicable)**

    - If the number of features is very high, employ techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.

6. **Model Selection and Training**

    - Evaluate various machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
    - Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal settings for each model.
    - Employ k-Fold Cross Validation for robust evaluation of model performance.
    - Select the best model with optimized settings for accurate predictions.

7. **Model Evaluation**

    - Assess the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared. The **85% accuracy** on the test set demonstrates the model's effectiveness.

8. **Visualization (optional)**

    - Create visualizations to explain model predictions and gain insights into factors that significantly influence house prices.
