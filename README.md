Data Science Workflow

Data Acquisition and Cleaning:

Load data from reliable sources.
Address missing values using appropriate techniques.
Ensure data integrity for accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilize Matplotlib to visualize relationships between features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms) and the target variable (house price).
Gain insights into the data distribution and identify potential patterns.
Outlier Detection and Treatment:

Identify outliers that could skew model predictions.
Strategically handle outliers using removal, transformation, or winsorization (capping extreme values).
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might be more informative for the model.
Examples could include:
Calculating price per square foot.
Creating categorical features for location categories.
Deriving a "year built" feature from the data.
Dimensionality Reduction (if applicable):

If the number of features is very high, employ techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
Model Selection and Training:

Evaluate various machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and k-Fold Cross Validation for robust evaluation.
Select the best model with optimized settings for accurate predictions.
Model Evaluation:

Assess the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared. The 85% accuracy on the test set demonstrates its effectiveness.
Visualization (optional):

Create visualizations to explain model predictions and gain insights into factors that significantly influence house prices.
